The original game of mine - a 2D quest game, where the player must resolve math tasks to progress in game and rescue the characher from the abandoned spaceship.


There is an .exe installator of the game (in the archive, the original .exe file was too weighty for github). Don't worry - the file is safe. It was my project I presented on several regional competitions of Moscow and awarder for.
